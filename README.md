# Docker Control

A simple utility for controlling the Docker service.

## Motivation

The utility was created due to a limitation in Docker for Windows 10 which prevents 
users from starting/stopping/restarting the Docker service from the command line.

## Requirements

* Windows 10

## Usage

The following commands are available:

* start
* stop
* restart
* version

The commands are invoked like this:

```bash
docker-control <command>
```
